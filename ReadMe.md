## Key Features

### Personalization

We understand that people care about different causes and seek to make a difference in different areas. With this in mind, we sought to provide a platform where Seekers can create and edit their profiles according to what you are looking for and what they want to showcase.

### Job Board

Our interactive job board enables users view information on roles/opportunities they may be interested in, with an option to view more about the company as well. We ensure that users can visibly see whether or not a company has been vetted and connect with Finders in peace.

### Connection

We successfully implemented a connect feature. Bringing a wrap to the core features we aimed to implement.
Now, Seekers (those who are looking to make a difference) can choose to connect with Finder (those who have found ways to make a difference and are open to collaborators). This feature provides a view wherein the Finder can view seekers who have sought to connect and the Seeker's name becomes a direct link to the Seeker's profile
As a safety feature, we ensure that you need to make a seeker profile first and log in before the connect button would work.

### Authentication/Security

A key feature in building trust is to ensure that Finder's and Seeker's data is secured. Providing multiple Oauth options, Microsoft, Google and Facebook, Seekers are afforded secure ways to create a profile and join our platform.

Furthermore, passwords are effectively hashed with a salt element, ensuring that even in the case of a data breach, their passwords remain secure

The use of Knex ensures that Align is protected from threats like SQL injections.

## Project status

Align is in development at this stage and will be workied on sparingly

## Further Development

- isCurrentUser middleware is merged for both Finders and Seekers now. This results in the side-effect that Finder and Seeker being able to edit eachothers profile if they have the same ID number. This can be solved by seperating the conditional inside the isCurrentUser function. Adding a isCurrentFinder & isCurrentSeeker boolean to the res.locals and proceeding to use those variables where needed throughout the appropriate views in handlebars.

- We are looking to ensure that after a seeker connects on a job, we need to make it so that the connect button changes into a checkmark. as currently, it can be clicked again and will return a console.log which will. make it visible for a seeker to see if they have already responde to the job.
  We suggest overhauling the middleware (see the second bulletpoint), or using "current user type" to check against seeker ID and if that ID shows up, add it as a template in the front end job file so it renders immediately.

- Overhauling the middleware functions. Currently we are using multiple authentication and usertype middleware functions. These could be merged into one that handles all needed checks and returns the needed variables. This would simplify the routers and make it easier to add variables in the future if needed.

- Flash messages are currently not visible due to the login/signup form changing back to its original state. Displaying the failureflash on the original form would be ideal, if possible.

- Expand "Connect" feature to include both Finder and Seeker profiles on top of the current Job functionality. Include safeguards to ensure that those who did not create their profile yet, are not able to click on connect.
